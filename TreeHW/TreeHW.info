        R-8.1:This question refers back to Figure 8.3
        R-8.5: Describe an algo, relying only on the BinaryTree operations,
        that counts the number of leaves in a binary tree that are the left
        child of their respective parent. 
        R-8.6: Let T be an n-node binary tree that may be improper. 
        Describe how to represent T by means of a proper binary
        tree T' with O(n) nodes.
        R-8.7: What are the maximum and minimum number 
        of internal and external nodes in an improper 
        binary tree with n nodes?
        R-8.22: Draw a binary tree that simultaneously satisfies 
        the following: 
           - each internal node of T stores a single character.
           - Preorder result: EXAMFUN.
           - Inorder result: MAFXUEN.
        R-8.25: Describe a modification of the method parenthesize, 
        from Code Fragment 8.26
        C-8.42: Give an efficient algo that computes and prints, for 
        every position p of a tree T, the element of p followed by the
        height of p's subtree.
        C-8.46: Describe, in pseudocode, a nonrecursive method 
        for performing an inorder traversal of a binary tree 
        in linear time.
