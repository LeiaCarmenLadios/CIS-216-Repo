        P-4.62: Perform an experimental analysis to test the hypothesis that
        Java's array sort method runs on O(nlogn) time on average. 
        
        Answer based on analysis:
        The Array.sort has a runtime that's less than or equal to
        the growth of the  reference function nlogn. We could say 
        that the .sort method has a runtime that's O(nlog(n)) as n reaches 
        infinity.
