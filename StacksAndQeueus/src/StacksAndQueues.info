        R-6.1:  Suppose an initially empty stack S has performed:
        			25 push operations, 
        			12 top operations, 
        			and 10 pop operations(3 of which returned null 
        			to indifcate an empty stack).
        		What is the current size of the stack?
	 																		  	
	 	R-6.2: Given Code Fragment 6.2, what would be the final value 
	 			of the instance variable t for the previous problem?
	 	
	 	R-6.5: Give a recursive method for removing all the elements from 
	 		  the stack. 
	 	
	 	C-6.24: Describe how you can use a queue to scan S to see if it 
	 			contains an element x, with an additional constraint 
	 			that you return all the elements back into the stack in
	 			their original order. You may only use the stack, queue,
	 			and a constant number of other primitive variables.
	 	
	 	C-6.30: Give pseudocode description of an array-based implementation
	 			of the double ended queue ADT. What is the running time for
	 			each operation. 
	 			
	 	C-6.31: Describe how to implement the deque ADT using two stacks 
	 			as the only instance variables. What are the running times
	 			of the methods?
